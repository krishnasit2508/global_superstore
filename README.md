Created a Power BI - Dashboard using Kaggle's dataset.

Project : BI Desktop - Dashboard

Concepts Used : Power BI, SQL, Excel, Data Processing, Data Visualisation.


I created this very simple Dashboard using Power BI. When we click on at any point, it displays the information regarding specific task. As you can see many simple tasks are displayed in the dashboard and they all are inter-linked. It displays the sales information year-wise. Also shows the top selling products and the products which should be discontinued. Also indicates the regions according to yearly sales.
